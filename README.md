# 🐶🐱 Cat vs Dog image classification
This project employs convolutional neural networks for accurate cat vs dog image classification. 

Welcome to the DogCat Classifier repository! This project is all about classifying adorable dog and cat images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) 🖼️. The model is trained on a fantastic dataset of 20,000 images sourced from Kaggle. Not only that, we've even deployed it using Streamlit for easy interaction.

## 📦 Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be found on Kaggle: [DogCat Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salader/dogs-vs-cats)

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The classifier harnesses the power of a CNN architecture, and we've taken it up a notch by employing the pre-trained VGG16 model through transfer learning for perfectly accurate predictions!
